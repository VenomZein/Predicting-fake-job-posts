# Predicting-fake-job-posts
Predicting the likelyhood of job post to be fake using shallow and deep learning algorithms

I have two files that focus on training Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to predict fake job posts using the same dataset.

1-The first file provides a comprehensive data analysis of the dataset, exploring its characteristics and trends. Additionally, it trains a model composed of various shallow learning models, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Logistic Regression. These models are well-suited for classification tasks and offer interpretable results, making them valuable for understanding the underlying patterns in the data.

2-The second file contains a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) model trained on the same dataset. Unlike the shallow learning models in the first file, the BiLSTM model is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that can capture long-term dependencies in sequential data. By leveraging both past and future context, the BiLSTM model can effectively learn intricate patterns in text data, making it particularly well-suited for NLP tasks like fake job post detection.

Both files aim to address the problem of identifying fake job posts using machine learning techniques, but they take different approaches in terms of model architecture and complexity.
